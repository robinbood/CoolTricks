# Webhooks

Webhooks are a way for applications to send automated messages or information to other applications. They are event-driven, meaning they are triggered by a specific event.

## How they work

1.  **Event Occurs:** An event happens in an application. For example, a new user signs up, a payment is processed, or a comment is posted on a blog.
2.  **Webhook Triggered:** The application with the webhook configured sends an HTTP request (usually a POST request) to a specific URL. This URL is provided by the receiving application.
3.  **Data Sent:** The HTTP request contains a payload of data related to the event. This data is typically in JSON or XML format.
4.  **Receiving Application Acts:** The receiving application gets the data and can then perform an action, such as updating its own database, sending a notification, or starting a workflow.

## Webhooks vs. Polling

| Feature | Webhooks (Push) | Polling (Pull) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Transfer** | Real-time | Delayed (depends on polling frequency) |
| **Efficiency** | Efficient, as data is sent only when an event occurs. | Inefficient, as it requires constant requests, even if there is no new data. |
| **Resource Usage**| Low on both ends. | High on both the client and server. |

## Common Use Cases

*   **Real-time Notifications:** Sending notifications to Slack or Discord when a new commit is pushed to a Git repository.
*   **E-commerce:** Updating an inventory management system when a product is sold on an e-commerce platform.
*   **Payment Processing:** Notifying a merchant's application when a payment is successfully processed by a payment gateway like Stripe.
*   **Marketing Automation:** Adding a new user to a mailing list in a marketing automation tool when they sign up on your website.
