## About this Project

This project serves as a practical playground for enhancing backend development skills while using modern tools:

- **TypeScript** for type-safe development
- **Bun** as a performant JavaScript runtime
- **React** for frontend implementation
- **Context API** for state management

The focus is on:
1. Building robust API endpoints
2. Implementing clean architecture patterns
3. Understanding state management flow
4. Writing maintainable, type-safe code

### Learning Goals
- Master TypeScript backend patterns
- Optimize server-side performance with Bun
- Practice clean code principles
- Improve API design skills
